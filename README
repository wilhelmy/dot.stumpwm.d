My personal stumpwm configuration

Special features compared to vanilla stumpwm:
* restores saved layouts and fixed groups on startup
* popup notifications for urgency hints
* using a prefix key feels clunky so I put a lot of keybindings into *top-map*
* includes swank so that I can connect emacs via 'slime-connect' (from EmacsWiki)

Tested with SBCL. Seems to work. Have fun!
